# Project Brief: BMad Short Drama Production Pack

## Executive Summary

The BMad Short Drama Production Pack is a specialized AI-powered framework designed to revolutionize the creation of vertical short dramas (micro-series). By combining viral content formulas with structured narrative engineering, it enables creators to produce high-retention, commercially viable scripts and visual assets at scale. This system addresses the unique demands of the "attention economy," where every second counts and conflict is the currency.

## Problem Statement

Creators of short dramas face unique challenges:
- **Retention Drop-off**: Viewers swipe away within 3 seconds if not immediately hooked.
- **Pacing Demands**: Traditional screenwriting is too slow; short dramas require 3x the plot density.
- **Visual Production**: Translating scripts to AI video (Sora/Vidu) requires specialized prompting skills.
- **Monetization**: Structuring cliffhangers effectively to drive "pay-to-unlock" conversion is an exact science.

## Proposed Solution

A specialized "Production Studio" team of AI agents:
- **Short Drama Structurer**: Architect of the 100-episode macro arc and micro-episode pacing.
- **Hook Specialist**: Master of the "Golden 3 Seconds."
- **Conflict Engineer**: Ensuring every scene has high-stakes confrontation.
- **Visual Director**: Translating text to executable AI video prompts.
- **Market Analyst**: Validating commercial viability and ROI.

## Target Users

- **Short Drama Studios**: Professional teams churning out 10+ series a month.
- **Independent Creators**: Solo creators using AI tools (Vidu, Runway) to produce full series.
- **MCNs / Agencies**: Managing multiple influencers and content lines.

## Goals & Success Metrics

- **Completion Rate**: Increase episode completion rate by 40%.
- **Pay-Point Conversion**: Improve click-through on locked episodes by 25%.
- **Production Speed**: Reduce script-to-video-prompt time by 70%.

## MVP Scope

- **Core Agents**: Structurer, Conflict, Hook, Visual Director fully operational.
- **Viral Workflows**: From concept to 100-episode outline.
- **Visual Pipeline**: Script to AI Prompt generation.
