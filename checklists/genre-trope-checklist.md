# Genre Trope Checklist

Use this to ensure you are delivering what the audience expects for the specific genre.

## 1. CEO / Dominant President
- [ ] **Wealth Display**: Is the CEO ridiculously rich (private jet, black card)?

- [ ] **Jealousy**: Is there a rival who tries to humiliate the lead?
- [ ] **Protection**: Does the CEO save the lead at a critical moment?

## 2. Revenge / Rebirth
- [ ] **The Injustice**: Is the protagonist's initial suffering extreme and unfair?
- [ ] **The Return**: Is the comeback dramatic (new look, new identity)?
- [ ] **The Slap**: Is there a physical or metaphorical "face slap" of the villain?
- [ ] **Begging**: Do the enemies eventually beg for mercy?

## 3. War God / Hidden Identity
- [ ] **Underestimation**: Do people treat the hero like trash?
- [ ] **The Signal**: Is there a phone call or token that reveals their true power?
- [ ] **The Kneel**: Do powerful people kneel before the hero?
- [ ] **Regret**: Do those who mocked the hero realize their mistake?

## 4. Sweet Pet / Romance
