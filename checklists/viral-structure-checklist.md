# Viral Short Drama Structure Checklist

Use this checklist to ensure your script follows the "Viral Formula" for vertical short dramas.

## 1. The Opening (First 10 Seconds)
- [ ] **Immediate Hook**: Does the first shot start *in media res* (in the middle of action)?
- [ ] **Visual Impact**: Is there a high-contrast or emotionally charged visual immediately?
- [ ] **Core Conflict**: Is the main conflict of the episode established within 10 seconds?
- [ ] **No Filler**: Are establishing shots (landscapes, buildings) removed or under 1 second?

## 2. The Middle (Development)
- [ ] **Information Density**: Are there at least 2 new pieces of plot information or emotional beats per minute?
- [ ] **Escalation**: Does the conflict get worse, not better?
- [ ] **Reversal**: Is there a small twist or shift in power dynamics?
- [ ] **Dialogue Speed**: Is the dialogue punchy (no long monologues)?

## 3. The Ending (The Anchor)
- [ ] **Cliffhanger**: Does the episode end on a question, a threat, or a revelation?
- [ ] **Emotional Peak**: Is the audience left feeling angry, excited, or shocked?
- [ ] **Curiosity Gap**: Is it physically difficult not to watch the next episode?

## 4. Overall Pacing
- [ ] **Scene Count**: Are there too many scenes? (Ideally 1-2 scenes per 1-2 min episode).
- [ ] **Movement**: Is the story moving forward every second?
