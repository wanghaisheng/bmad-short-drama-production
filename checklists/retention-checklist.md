# Audience Retention Checklist

Use this to diagnose why viewers might be swiping away.

## 1. The Boredom Test
- [ ] **Slow Starts**: Does the scene take more than 2 seconds to start?
- [ ] **Dead Air**: Are there pauses in dialogue or action?
- [ ] **Repetition**: Is information repeated unnecessarily?

## 2. The Confusion Test
- [ ] **Visual Clarity**: Is it clear who is talking?
- [ ] **Goal Clarity**: Do we know what the character wants *right now*?
- [ ] **Context**: Is the setting clear without a long establishing shot?

## 3. The "Payoff" Test
- [ ] **Emotional Release**: After tension, is there a release (laugh, cry, shock)?
- [ ] **Expectation**: Did the scene deliver what the hook promised?
- [ ] **Next Step**: Is the reason to watch the next episode clear?

## 4. Platform Fit
- [ ] **Text Size**: Is on-screen text readable on a phone?
- [ ] **Sound**: Does it work with sound off (captions)?
- [ ] **Loopability**: (For TikTok) Does the end loop back to the start?
