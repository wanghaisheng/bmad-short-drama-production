# Hook Effectiveness Checklist

Use this to test if your opening 3 seconds will stop the scroll.

## 1. Visual Hook
- [ ] **Face Close-up**: Is there an attractive or expressive face immediately?
- [ ] **Action**: Is there movement (running, slapping, falling)?
- [ ] **Setting**: Is the location visually expensive or intriguing?
- [ ] **Text Overlay**: Is there a compelling title or question on screen?

## 2. Narrative Hook
- [ ] **In Media Res**: Does it start in the middle of a crisis?
- [ ] **Burning Question**: Does the viewer immediately ask "What is happening?"
- [ ] **Immediate Stakes**: Is someone in danger or being humiliated?

## 3. Audio Hook
- [ ] **Sound Effect**: Is there a slap, a crash, or a scream?
- [ ] **Dialogue**: Is the first line provocative? (e.g., "Divorce me!", "You're fired!")
- [ ] **Music**: Does the music start with high energy?

## 4. The "Golden 3 Seconds" Test
- [ ] **Clarity**: Can I understand the situation in 3 seconds?
- [ ] **Interest**: Do I want to see the 4th second?
