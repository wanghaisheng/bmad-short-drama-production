# Conflict Intensity Checklist

Use this checklist to verify that your scenes have enough dramatic tension to retain viewers.

## 1. Conflict Type
- [ ] **External Conflict**: Is there a clear antagonist or obstacle?
- [ ] **Physical Manifestation**: Is the conflict visible (shouting, fighting, breaking things)?
- [ ] **Status Play**: Is one character trying to dominate the other?

## 2. The Stakes
- [ ] **High Stakes**: Is something life-changing at risk (love, money, life, reputation)?
- [ ] **Urgency**: Does this need to happen *now*?
- [ ] **No Going Back**: Will the outcome of this conflict permanently change the relationship?

## 3. Emotional Impact
- [ ] **Visceral Reaction**: Does the scene trigger anger, fear, or justice?
- [ ] **Empathy**: Do we feel the protagonist's pain/humiliation?
- [ ] **Satisfaction**: If it's a "face-slapping" scene, is the release satisfying?

## 4. Escalation
- [ ] **Rising Volume**: Do arguments get louder or more intense?
- [ ] **Physicality**: Do characters invade each other's personal space?
- [ ] **Irreversible Words**: Do they say things they can't take back?
