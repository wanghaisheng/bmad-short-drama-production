# Commercial Viability Checklist

This checklist is used by the **Market Analyst** to evaluate the monetization potential and ROI of a short drama series.

## 1. Pay Point Placement (付费点卡点)
- [ ] **Hook Strength**: Does the free episode end with a massive cliffhanger?
- [ ] **Emotional Investment**: Is the audience emotionally attached to the protagonist *before* the paywall?
- [ ] **Curiosity Gap**: Does the pay point raise a question that *must* be answered immediately?
- [ ] **Impulse Trigger**: Is there a "slap in the face" or "identity reveal" moment right at the lock?

## 2. Audience Targeting (受众定位)
- [ ] **Core Demographic**: Is the target audience clearly defined (e.g., Male 25-40, Female 18-35)?
- [ ] **Trope Alignment**: Does the story fit the specific desires of that demographic (e.g., Power fantasy for men, Emotional revenge for women)?
- [ ] **Pacing Match**: Is the pacing fast enough for the platform's user behavior (TikTok/Reels/Shorts)?

## 3. Market Trend Alignment (市场风向)
- [ ] **Keyword Match**: Does the title/concept contain current trending keywords (e.g., "CEO", "Divorce", "Trillionaire")?
- [ ] **Saturation Check**: Is this specific sub-genre currently oversaturated? If so, what is the twist?
- [ ] **Visual Appeal**: Are there visually striking elements (luxury, combat, transformation) suitable for ads?

## 4. Monetization Strategy
- [ ] **Series Length**: Is the episode count optimal for the story arc (usually 80-100 episodes)?
- [ ] **Filler Check**: Are there "water" episodes that can be cut to improve density?
- [ ] **Sequel Potential**: Is the universe expandable?
